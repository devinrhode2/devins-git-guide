shuffling or reordering commits is a thing

while the natural order you completed things is a pretty good default, you may at times want to shuffle or re-order commits into a more logical flow. GitHub desktop gui git client makes re-ordering commits particularly easy.

You usually wont encounter just one conflict when shuffling. You'll usually encounter pairs if conflicts, which are basically a reflection of each other, basically opposites.

As with any conflict, we have two conflict hunks. You usually want something from bothhunks.

If you are end up havibg two conflicts, which hunk is more meaningful will flip. First conflict, you may mostly discard the top hunk - second conflict, you'll mostly want the bottom one.
